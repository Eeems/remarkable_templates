## Daily journal
![](journal.png)

I keep daily journal every morning. I start with stating 3 gratitudes and the remaining is free-form writing. At the end I assess how I feel. 

## Daily planner
![](daily_planner.png)

I use this template to review my daily priorities and agenda a day before. At the end of the day, I fill in the bottom part with TIL, reflections. I compare the stars in this template with the hearts in *Daily Journal* to see if there is a discrepancy. The section with the icons are representing the behaviors that I'd like to incorporate in my life:

* Each **pomodoro** icon represents a [pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) session (25mins work/5mins break) 
* I have a [**FOCI**](https://fociai.com/) device which logs my emoitions throughout the day. It also provides the amount of time that I spend in focus daily. Every clock icon represents 30mins of focus time.
* Each **water droplet** represents 500ml of water
* Each **workout** and **meditation** icon represents 30mins
 

## Weekly planner
